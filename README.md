# Byte-Sized Bio

This is a personal bio site built with React, showcasing a little bit of who I am — professionally and otherwise.

🛠️ **Work in Progress**  
This project is still under development. The plan is to eventually deploy it using GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions, but that setup will come once the site design and content are finalized.

## 📁 Sections

- **About:** Includes a short bio, photos of my chaos crew (ferrets and cats), and links to my socials.
- **Projects:** Highlights some of the things I’ve built or worked on. One of those — an API-based project — is still in early development. It's something I’m excited about, but like many personal projects, it’s waiting on time I haven’t quite found yet.

## 💅 Styling

This project uses **[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)** for styling. It provides accessible, composable React components out of the box, and makes it easy to iterate quickly with a consistent design system.

## 🚧 Planned Features

- Fully responsive layout
- JSON-driven content for easy updates
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages deployment (coming once stable)
- Expandable project gallery with live links and demos

## 🧪 Local Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
