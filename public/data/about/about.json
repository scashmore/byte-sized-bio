    "bio": "Hi! I'm Susan. A software developer by day, musician by heart, and amateur dessert alchemist by night. I’m drawn to work that makes a real difference. Whether I’m debugging code or writing something new, I care about building tools and systems that serve a purpose and help people.\n\nThat’s part of why I play the oboe, too. Music has a way of reaching people directly, of creating connection without explanation. I aim for that same sense of clarity and purpose in the work I do.\n\nOutside of work, I love experimenting in the kitchen (because gluten-free bakeries are overpriced lies and bread is one thing I’m definitely not willing to give up). I also share my home with ferrets and cats — it's less “pet owner” and more “live-in staff,” but we make it work.",
